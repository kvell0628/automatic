<p>A dialog for selecting the output file is presented. After the file name has
been specified, a second dialog asks you for the bitmap size and the preferred
background color. 
<br />Note that exporting to bitmaps with a very large size can take a long
time, depending on your hardware. The maximum size for bitmaps is width x
height â‰¤ 2.147.483.647.</p>
