<p>The import command inserts a drawing from a file on disk into the current
drawing.
<br />All layers that are used by the imported drawing are added to the
layer list of the current drawing. Existing layers with the same name can be
overwritten if desired ("overwrite layers" option in the options tool bar). 
<br />Block references of the imported drawing will be inserted together with
the block definitions they refer to. Blocks in the current drawing can be
overwritten if desired ("overwrite blocks" option in the options tool bar). 
<br />The options tool bar also offers some tools to scale, rotate or flip the
imported drawing while positioning it.</p>
