Create new, empty drawings using this command. New drawings are completely
empty (no entities, only one default layer, no blocks). As a frequent user of
QCAD, you might instead want to create drawing templates with the layers and
blocks you use the most and probably a drawing border. Once you have such a
template you can load that instead of starting a new drawing from scratch. 
<br />Please refer also to the command 
<a href="../../../Pro/File/NewFromTemplate/doc/NewFromTemplate_en.html">New
from Template</a> 
to learn how to use drawing templates.
