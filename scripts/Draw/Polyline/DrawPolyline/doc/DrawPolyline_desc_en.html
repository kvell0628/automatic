<p>This tool lets you draw polylines. A polyline is a continuous line formed
from one or more connected line or arc segments. 
<br />Please note that it is almost always more convenient to use the regular
line and arc tools to draw a new polyline. The loosely connected line and arc
segments can then be converted into a polyline entity using the "Create
Polyline from Segments" tool.</p>
