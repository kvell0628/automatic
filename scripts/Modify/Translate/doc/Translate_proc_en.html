  <li>Select the entities you want to move or copy.</li>
  <li>Launch this tool.</li>
  <li>Set the reference point with the mouse or enter a coordinate in the
  command line.</li>
  <li>Set the target point. To move the selected entities by a given amount,
  enter a relative coordinate. For example to move it by 50 drawing units to
  the right, enter @50,0 in the command line.</li>
  <li>The move dialog is displayed. 
  <br />To move the entities, choose "Delete Original", to copy them choose
  "Keep Original". You can also create any given number of copies at once by
  choosing "Multiple Copies" and entering the number of copies in the text line
  below. Note that "9" will create 9 copies and keep the original - so there
  will be 10 instances of the selected entities in the end. 
  <br />The new entities are placed on the same layer as the originals and have
  the same attributes. To use the current layer and current attributes instead,
  tick "Use current layer and attributes".</li>
